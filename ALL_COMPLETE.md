## 🚀 How to Push to GitHub

### Step 1: Create Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `AI-NIDS`
3. Description: `AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection with Explainable AI`
4. Visibility: `Public`
5. DO NOT initialize with README (you have one already)
6. Click `Create repository`

### Step 2: Push Code

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "e:\Internships and Projects\Ethical Hacking\AI Network Intrusion Detection System"

# Initialize git (if not done)
git init

# Add all files
git add -A

# Create commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI-NIDS v1.0 - Complete Network Intrusion Detection System"

# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/AI-NIDS.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Configure GitHub

In repository settings:
- Add topics: `ai`, `machine-learning`, `cybersecurity`, `network-security`, `ids`
- Set license: MIT (should auto-detect)
- Enable: Discussions, Issues, Projects
- Configure branch protection on main
