## Our Values in Practice

### Examples of Positive Community

**✅ Good: Constructive Feedback**
```
"I found a potential issue with the XGBoost model accuracy on the DDoS detection. 
I noticed the false positive rate increased in the latest version. Would it be 
helpful if I investigated this further and submitted a PR with potential fixes?"
```

**✅ Good: Welcoming New Members**
```
"Welcome to the project! I see this is your first contribution. Here are some 
great issues for beginners. Feel free to ask questions in GitHub discussions 
or our Slack channel. Looking forward to your contributions!"
```

**✅ Good: Disagreeing Respectfully**
```
"I understand your perspective on using ensemble learning. I see the benefits, 
but I have concerns about the increased computational cost. Could we discuss 
trade-offs and maybe run some performance benchmarks?"
```

### Examples of Unacceptable Behavior

**❌ Bad: Dismissive Tone**
```
"That's a stupid idea. No one would want this feature."
```

**❌ Bad: Gatekeeping**
```
"You're clearly not experienced enough to contribute to this project."
```

**❌ Bad: Unwelcome Attention**
```
"Hey [username], can we take this to private messages? 😉"
```
